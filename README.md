# liri-node-app

The LIRI app searches for movies, cocerts and songs using multiple APIs.

**App Use Instructions in Node.js CLI.**

Search commands should be entered in this fashion:

`$ node liri.js search-command search item or items`

1. To search for a Movie use command `movie-this movie name`
2. To search for a Concert use command `concert-this artist or band name`
3. To search for a Song use command `spotify-this-song song name`
4. To search for a random item use command `do-what-it-says`

LIRI will save the items you search into the _log.txt_ local file.
